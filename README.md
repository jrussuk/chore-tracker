## ⚠️ Common Issues

### "Chore button not working"
- Check internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- If still broken, check Google Sheet is accessible

### "I did a chore but it's not showing"
- Check you tapped the right button
- Look in Google Sheet CompletedLog
- Parents can manually add if needed

### "Wrong person assigned to cat chores"
- Check today's date (odd vs. even)
- Rule is by day of month, not day of week

### "Dispute about who did more"
- Open Google Sheet CompletedLog
- Filter by date range
- Count actual entries (facts trump feelings!)

## 🎓 Teaching Accountability

### Week 1-2: Training Phase
- Check in daily with kids
- Remind them to log chores
- Celebrate when they remember

### Week 3-4: Independence

- Only intervene if obvious gaps

### Week 5+: Autonomous
- Kids check app themselves
- Parents review weekly only
- System becomes habit
